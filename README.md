## 🚀 **Why This Exists**  
Because:  
- `crunch` is for boomers  
- Writing wordlists manually is for masochists  
- You *know* 90% of routers still use `Password123`  

---

## 💻 **Features That Don't Suck**  
✅ **Smart pattern generation** (targets ISP defaults like `VMEDIA12345`)  
✅ **Human-readable templates** (no cryptic crunch syntax)  
✅ **Built-in troll detection** (won't generate `password` unless you *really* want it)  

```python
# Sample output everyone will ignore anyway
["RouterGod", "FluffyBunny42", "Changeme_69"]
